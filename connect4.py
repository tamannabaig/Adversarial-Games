"""
In this assignment, the task is to implement adversarial search algorithms with depth
limit for a Connect-4 game.

To complete the assignment, you must finish these functions:
    minimax (line 161), alphabeta (line 196), and expectiminimax (line 235)
in this file.

In the Connect-4 game, two players place discs in a 6-by-7 board one by one.
The discs will fall straight down and occupy the lowest available space of
the chosen column. The player wins if four of his or her discs are connected
in a line horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four for more about Connect-4 games.


A Board() class is provided to simulate the game board.
It has the following properties:
    b.rows          # number of rows of the game board
    b.cols          # number of columns of the game board
    b.PLAYER1       # an integer flag to represent the player 1
    b.PLAYER2       # an integer flag to represent the player 2
    b.EMPTY_SLOT    # an integer flag to represent an empty slot in the board;

and the following methods:
    b.terminal()            # check if the game is terminal
                            # terminal means draw or someone wins
    b.has_draw()            # check if the game is a draw
    w = b.who_wins()        # return the winner of the game or None if there
    assert(w in [b.PLAYER1, b.PLAYER2, None])   # no winner yet?

    b.occupied(row, col)    # check if the slot at the specific location is
                            # occupied
    x = b.get(row, col)     # get the player occupying the given slot
    assert(x in [b.PLAYER1, b.PLAYER2, b.EMPTY_SLOT])
    row = b.row(r)          # get the specific row of the game described using
                            # b.PLAYER1, b.PLAYER2 and b.EMPTY_SLOT
    col = b.column(r)       # get a specific column of the game board

    b.placeable(col)        # check if a checker can be placed at the specific
                            # column
    b.place(player, col)    # place a checker at the specific column for player
        # raise ValueError if the specific column does not have available space
    
    new_board = b.clone()   # return a new board instance having the same
                            # checker placement with b

    str = b.dump()          # a string to describe the game board using
